Today, we're going to be looking at **deduplication**.\n\n\"Duplication\" just means that you have repeated data in your dataset. This could be due to things like data entry errors or data collection methods. For example, if you're using a web scraper you may happen to scrape the same webpage more than once, or the same information from two different pages. \nWhatever the reason, deduplication can lead you to make incorrect conclusions by leading you to believe that some observations are more common than they really are.\n\nToday we're going to learn how to find and remove duplicate records. (Removing duplicates is called \"deduplication\".) Here's a quick overview of what we'll be doing today.\n\n* Visualizing duplication \n* Finding & removing exact duplicates\n* Finding & removing partial duplicates\n\nI'll start by introducing each concept or technique, and then you'll get a chance to apply it with an exercise (look for the **Your turn!** section). Ready? Let's get started!\n\n___\n\n**Kernel FAQs:**\n\n* **How do I get started?**   To get started, click the blue \"Fork Notebook\" button in the upper, right hand corner. This will create a private copy of this notebook that you can edit and play with. Once you're finished with the exercises, you can choose to make your notebook public to share with others. :)\n\n* **How do I run the code in this notebook?** Once you fork the notebook, it will open in the notebook editor. From there you can write code in any code cell (the ones with the grey background) and run the code by either 1) clicking in the code cell and then hitting CTRL + ENTER or 2) clicking in the code cell and the clicking on the white \"play\" arrow to the left of the cell. If you want to run all the code in your notebook, you can use the double, \"fast forward\" arrows at the bottom of the notebook editor.\n\n* **How do I save my work?** Any changes you make are saved automatically as you work. You can run all the code in your notebook and save a static version by hitting the blue \"Commit & Run\" button in the upper right hand corner of the editor. \n\n* **How can I find my notebook again later?** The easiest way is to go to your user profile (https://www.kaggle.com/replace-this-with-your-username), then click on the \"Kernels\" tab. All of your kernels will be under the \"Your Work\" tab, and all the kernels you've upvoted will be under the \"Favorites\" tab.\n\n___\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"640f8797-70e7-4fad-8723-66e58476e658","_uuid":"5df79f2b00a3dbd89d1c9a21fbb7564a93a6ba52"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Get our environment set up\n___\n\nBefore we get started, we need to get our environment set up.

More than one record associated with the same observation, but the values in the rows are not exactly the same.

Let's take a look at how many rows are duplicated in our dataset and where they are. There are a couple reasons you may want to do this:\n\n1. See how much duplicated data you have. If you only have a couple duplicates, or even none, you can just move on without worrying about them.\n2. See if there are any patterns in duplication. One fairly common pattern is that you'll see big blocks of duplicates due to data being copy and pasted at the end of existing data. If that's the case, you can just remove those rows from your dataframe and call it a day.\n\nTo plot duplicates, I'm first going to create a dataframe with 1) a logical vector indicating whether or not a specific row is duplicated elsewhere in the dataset and 2) a numeric vector of the index of each row. (I'm not using row numbers because if you're using the Tidyverse version of a dataframe, the get removed whenever you manipulate the dataframe.)

Removing partial duplicates, on the other hand, is much more complex. Fortunately, there are some handy tools we can use to make the process easier. I particularly like the [the dedup() function from the scrubr package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scrubr/vignettes/scrubr_vignette.html) by Scott Chamberlain. (If you haven't run into it before, the scrubr package can help you with a lot of different data cleaning tasks, like removing impossible latitude and longitude coordinates or standardizing dates.)\n\nOne of the hassles of removing partial duplicates is that it tends to take a long time. This is because you need to make a long of different comparisons to determine which rows only partially match with other ones. It's also because, in this case, we're actually converting every row to a string and then [comparing how similar the strings are](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/qlcMatrix/versions/0.9.5/topics/sim.strings) (this can help you catch things like slightly misspelled names). Since it takes longer the larger your dataset it, I'm going to use just the first twenty rows of the IGN dataset for this example so it doesn't take forever.
