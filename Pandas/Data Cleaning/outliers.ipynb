Today, we're going to be looking at **outliers**.\n\nOutliers are those data points that are really far from the rest of your data points. They can show up due to errors in data entry or measurement, or just because there's variation in the the population you're looking at and you happened to see one of the more unusual values. Whatever the reason they show up, knowing how to identify and handle outliers is an important part of data cleaning. Today, we're going to learn how to:\n\n* Visualize outliers\n* Identify which rows in our dataframe contain outliers\n* Pick and apply different strategies for handling outliers\n\nI'll start by introducing each concept or technique, and then you'll get a chance to apply it with an exercise (look for the **Your turn!** section). Ready? Let's get started!\n\n___\n\n**Kernel FAQs:**\n\n* **How do I get started?**   To get started, click the blue \"Fork Notebook\" button in the upper, right hand corner. This will create a private copy of this notebook that you can edit and play with. Once you're finished with the exercises, you can choose to make your notebook public to share with others. :)\n\n* **How do I run the code in this notebook?** Once you fork the notebook, it will open in the notebook editor. From there you can write code in any code cell (the ones with the grey background) and run the code by either 1) clicking in the code cell and then hitting CTRL + ENTER or 2) clicking in the code cell and the clicking on the white \"play\" arrow to the left of the cell. If you want to run all the code in your notebook, you can use the double, \"fast forward\" arrows at the bottom of the notebook editor.\n\n* **How do I save my work?** Any changes you make are saved automatically as you work. You can run all the code in your notebook and save a static version by hitting the blue \"Commit & Run\" button in the upper right hand corner of the editor. \n\n* **How can I find my notebook again later?** The easiest way is to go to your user profile (https://www.kaggle.com/replace-this-with-your-username), then click on the \"Kernels\" tab. All of your kernels will be under the \"Your Work\" tab, and all the kernels you've upvoted will be under the \"Favorites\" tab.\n\n___\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"cc4df45cbcc16f7528f979588375d2400a30cef8","_cell_guid":"f21298a4-a5ae-449e-86cf-a5fabc017833"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Get our environment set up\n___\n\nFirst, let's read in the libraries and data we'll be using.

In plain English, it's a data point that's very far from the other data points. Mathematically, an outlier is usually defined as an observation more than three standard deviations from the mean (although sometimes you'll see 2.5 or 2 as well). It's not [the only mathmatical definition](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5935/f52caf1df059ed9e301ad1fbfbd8d01bfa18.pdf), but since it's the one that's used the most often that's what we'll use here as well. \n\n> **Z-score**: The number of standard deviations away from the mean that a particular observation is. (You can see the mathematical definition [here](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/z-Score.html), if you're curious.) A negative Z-score means an observation is below the mean, while a positive one means it above it. The further away from 0 the Z-Score is, the further away from the mean your observation is. \n\nOne of the easiest ways to see if your dataset has outliers is to plot your data. The type of plot you pick will depend on how many and what kind of variable you're interesting in looking at. Today, we're going to look at three different plots.\n\n## Univariate outliers\n\nUnivariate just means \"one variable\". When I'm looking for variation in just one variable, I like to use boxplots. This is because outliers are shown as points on a box plot, so it's easy to see if we have any outliers in our data. In this notebook, I'll be using the `geom_boxplot()` function from ggp2lot.  \n\n> **Haven't used ggplot before?** The syntax is pretty different from the basic `plot()` function in R. You might like to check out [this tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/visualizing-data-with-ggplot2) to help you get started.\n\nFor this example, we're going to look at the refund value for the different refunds made to members of Brazil's  House of Deputies."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"934d9fb474daed83e8f5c845f4ec34d127fea51c","_cell_guid":"f6e31347-c850-4c9a-98a4-d5d0b3850364","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# use a box plot to see if we have outliers in the refund_value column\n# of the data_v2 dataset\nggplot(data_v2, aes(x = \"refund_value\", y = refund_value)) +\n    geom_boxplot()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c98f88820de811c10f6f7f885e6037fde22dc503","_cell_guid":"d1278224-cea9-4349-9eca-54c238c47c54"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Wow, it looks like we have a lot of outliers!

Especially if you're planning on doing some sort of regression, you definitely want to know if you have values that are far off trend.\n\nThe best way to look for outliers in two numeric variables is using a scatter plot.
